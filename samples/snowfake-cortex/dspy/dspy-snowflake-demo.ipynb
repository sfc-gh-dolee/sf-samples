(The other titles in the series are \"The Constant Princess,\" \"The Queen\\'s Fool,\" \"The Virgin\\'s Lover,and The Other Queen.\") * The novel is told through the first-person narratives of – Anne of Cleves, Katherine Howard, and Jane Boleyn, who was mentioned in \"The Other Boleyn Girl.\" It covers a period from 1539 until 1542 and chronicles the fourth and fifth marriages of King Henry VIII of England.', 'Gregory of Gaeta | Gregory was the Duke of Gaeta from 963 until his death. He was the second son of Docibilis II of Gaeta and his wife Orania. He succeeded his brother John II, who had left only daughters. Gregory rapidly depleted the \"publicum\" (public land) of the Duchy of Gaeta by doling it out to family members as grants. Gregory disappears from the records in 964 and was succeeded by his younger brother Marinus of Fondi over the heads of his three sons. It is possible that there was an internal power struggle between factions of the Docibilan family and that Gregory was forced out. On the other hand, perhaps he died and his sons fought a losing battle for their inheritance to Gaeta.', 'The Queen\\'s Fool | The Queen\\'s Fool by Philippa Gregory is a 2004 historical fiction novel. Set between 1548 and 1558, it is part of Philippa Gregory\\'s Tudor series. The series includes \"The Boleyn Inheritance\". The novel chronicles the changing fortunes of Mary I of England and her half-sister Elizabeth through the eyes of the fictional Hannah Green, a Marrano girl escaping to England from Spain where her mother was burned at the stake for being Jewish. Hannah is discovered by Robert Dudley and John Dee and subsequently begged as a fool to Edward VI. She witnesses and becomes caught up the intrigues of the young king\\'s court, and later those of his sisters. As Mary, Elizabeth, and Robert Dudley use Hannah to gather information on their rivals and further their own aims, the novel can plausibly present each side in the complex story. \"The Queen\\'s Fool\" follows Hannah from ages fourteen to nineteen, and her coming-of-age is interspersed among the historical narrative (see Bildungsroman).

The first US edition appeared under the title \"The Complete Compleat Enchanter\", and replaces the foreword with a preface by David Drake. That edition was published by Baen Books in 1989, and has been reprinted a number of times since. Orion Books published an edition in the UK under the title \"The Compleat Enchanter\" in 2000 as volume 10 of their Fantasy Masterworks series. The stories in the collection were originally published in magazine form in the May 1940, August 1940 and April 1941 issues of \"Unknown\", the June 1953 issue of \"Beyond Fantasy\", and the October 1954 issue of \"Fantasy\".»\\n[5] «Heaven, We Inherit a Castle | Heaven, We Inherit a Castle (German: Himmel, wir erben ein Schloß) is a 1943 German comedy film directed by Peter Paul Brauer and starring Anny Ondra, Hans Brausewetter and Carla Rust. The film was shot in German-occupied Prague, Ondra\\'s hometown, by the Prag-Film company. It was Ondra\\'s last starring role.»\\n[6] «Kinnairdy Castle | Kinnairdy Castle is a tower house, having five storeys and a garret, two miles south of Aberchirder, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. The alternative name is Old Kinnairdy.»\\n[7] «Kinnaird Castle, Brechin | Kinnaird Castle is a 15th-century castle in Angus, Scotland. The castle has been home to the Carnegie family, the Earl of Southesk, for more than 600 years.»\\n[8] «Kinnaird Head | Kinnaird Head (Scottish Gaelic: \"An Ceann Àrd\" , \"high headland\") is a headland projecting into the North Sea, within the town of Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire on the east coast of Scotland. The 16th-century Kinnaird Castle was converted in 1787 for use as the Kinnaird Head Lighthouse, the first lighthouse in Scotland to be lit by the Commissioners of Northern Lights. Kinnaird Castle and the nearby Winetower were described by W. Douglas Simpson as two of the nine castles of the Knuckle, referring to the rocky headland of north-east Aberdeenshire. Both buildings are category A listed buildings.»\\n[9] «Thrawn Janet | \"Thrawn Janet\" is a short story, written in Scots, by the Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson. He wrote the story in the summer of 1881 while he stayed at the rented Kinnaird Cottage in Kinnaird, a hamlet near Pitlochry, with his parents and wife. When he read the story to his wife Fanny, she said of it that it \"sent a cauld grue [shudder] along my bones\" and \"fair frightened\" Stevenson himself. It was first published in the October 1881 issue of the \"Cornhill Magazine\". It is a dark tale of satanic possession.»\\n[10] «Kinfauns Castle | Kinfauns Castle was designed by Robert Smirke and built between 1822 and 1826 by Lord Gray on the site of a medieval stronghold. It is situated in Perth and Kinross, Scotland, and is currently occupied by Scottish businesswoman Ann Gloag. The house is protected as a category A listed building, and the grounds are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland.»\\n[11] «Kinlochaline Castle | Kinlochaline Castle is a 12th-century Scottish fortress on the Ardtornish estate in Morvern in the Highland council area. It is also known as Caisteal an Ime (Scottish Gaelic for \"Castle of Butter\") because a Lady of Clan MacInnes, Dubh Chal (Lady of the Black Veil), is said to have paid the builder with butter equal to the volume of the castle.»\\n[12] «Kinloch Castle | Kinloch Castle (Scottish Gaelic: \"Caisteal Cheann Locha\" ) is a late Victorian mansion located on the Isle of Rùm, one of the Small Isles off the west coast of Scotland. It was built as a private residence for Sir George Bullough, a textile tycoon from Lancashire whose father bought Rùm as his summer residence and shooting estate. Construction began in 1897, and was completed in 1900. Built as a luxurious retreat, Kinloch Castle has since declined. The castle and island are now owned by Scottish Natural Heritage, and part of the castle operates as a hostel. The Kinloch Castle Friends Association was established in 1996 to secure the long-term future of the building.»\\n\\nQuestion: How many stories did the castle that David Gregory inherited have?\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to Five stories and a garret. Reference(s): [1] «David Gregory (physician) | David Gregory (20 December 1625 – 1720) was a Scottish physician and inventor. His surname is sometimes spelt as Gregorie, the original Scottish spelling. He inherited Kinnairdy Castle in 1664. Three of his twenty-nine children became mathematics professors. He is credited with inventing a military cannon that Isaac Newton described as \"being destructive to the human species\". Copies and details of the model no longer exist.
